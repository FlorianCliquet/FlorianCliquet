Hello,
My name is Florian Cliquet, I am a French student who aims to improve in computer science during my studies in order to work in cybersecurity.
This program must be one of my multiple programs which are on Github for the sole purpose of being published on my portfolio and/or accessing the advantages of Github for previous versions and the security that this brings to my code.
If you want to use my code, just contact me with my email: florian.cliquet.pro@gmail.com.
I am still only a junior developer, I do lots of programs in order to discover everything and improve myself in all possible and unimaginable areas in IT.
Happy reading !
